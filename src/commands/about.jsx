            Hey, I’m <b>A</b>bhishek <b>K</b>rishna — a backend and systems engineer who loves building
            efficient, crash-proof systems. I work close to the metal and believe
            real performance comes from understanding how things work under the hood.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
            I’m passionate about <b>Linux, backend architecture, and low-level systems</b>.
            I also love crafting web apps with <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Supabase</b>, and <b>React</b>.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
            When I’m not coding, I’m probably doing a home workout, experimenting with Linux setups,
            or learning how to make systems faster and smarter.
